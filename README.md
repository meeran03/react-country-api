# Rest Country API
A simple project that fetches country data from an external api and then shows in datatables.

# Aim of this Project
  - to learn the usage of axios post and get request to access API endpoints
  - to understand how to manipulate data and develop efficent algorithms for fast processing
  - to utilize the power of javascript map, reduce and other array functions
  - to use mui-datatables for the effective sorting, pagination, and searching
  - to implement a code organizational style for effective software architecture
  - to make REACTJS code efficient by using useMemo, useCallback

# The need
This is one of the simplest yet most useful projects that I have made. It has covered almost all concepts of REACTJS from advanced concepts to the most basic ones. Connecting to an API endpoint effectively and keeping track of every request is an import thing. You can see the code structure to understand the power of code organization. Happy Coding ! :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
